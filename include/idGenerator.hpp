* Unique ID allows for project organization

* 
* Files contain a 2-part unique ID.
* First half is the unique txt file identifier.
* Second half is project identifier.
* 
* Figure out some kind of unique id hash generating technique
* to store two 32 uint32's in a 64bit int?
* 
* or maybe create two unique string hash id's for first and second half?
